# ImOk

This is a front-end for a PhoneGap Android app that allows someone to let a close contact know they are ok with one touch.

The server side (back-end) allowed the emergency contact (family/parents) to see how often they checked in and their locations.

This was aimed at international students who wanted to easily let their parents know they were ok.
